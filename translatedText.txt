“We should start back,” Gared urged as la woods began a grow dark around them. “la wildlings are dead.”

“Do la dead frighten you?” Ser Waymar Royce asked with just la hint of a smile.

Gared did not rise al bait. He was an old man, past fifty, and he had seen la lordlings come and go. “Dead is dead,” he said. “We have no business with la dead.”

“Are they dead?” Royce asked softly. “What proof have we?”

“Will saw them,” Gared said. “If he says they are dead, that’s proof enough for me.”

Will had known they would drag him into la quarrel sooner or later. He wished it had been later rather than sooner. “My mother told me that dead men sing no songs,” he put in.

“My wet nurse said la same thing, Will,” Royce replied. “Never believe anything you hear at a woman’s tit. There are things a be learned even from la dead.” His voice echoed, too loud in la twilit forest.

“We have a long ride before us,” Gared pointed out. “Eight days, maybe nine. y night is falling.”

Ser Waymar Royce glanced at la sky with disinterest. “It does that every day about this time. Are you unmanned by la dark, Gared?”

Will could see la tightness around Gared’s mouth, la barely suppressed anger in his eyes under la thick black hood of his cloak. Gared had spent forty years in la Night’s Watch, man y boy, y he was not accustomed a being made light of. Yet it was more than that. Under la wounded pride, Will could sense something else in la older man. You could taste it; una nervous tension that came perilous close a fear.

Will shared his unease. He had been four years on la Wall. la first time he had been sent beyond, all la old stories had come rushing back, y his bowels had turned a water. He had laughed about it afterward. He was una veteran de un hundred rangings by now, y el endless dark wilderness that la southron called la haunted forest had no more terrors for him.

Until tonight. Something was different tonight. There was an edge a this darkness that made his hackles rise. Nine days they had been riding, north y northwest y then north again, farther y farther from la Wall, hard on la track de un band de wildling raiders. Each day had been worse than la day that had come before it. Today fue el worst de all. una cold wind fue blowing out del north, y it made la trees rustle like living things. All day, Will had felt as though something were watching him, something cold y implacable that loved him not. Gared had felt it too. Will wanted nothing so much as a ride hellbent for la safety del Wall, but that fue not una feeling a share with your commander.

Especially not una commander like this one.

Ser Waymar Royce fue el youngest son de an ancient house with too many heirs. El era un handsome youth de eighteen, grey-eyed y graceful y slender as una knife. Mounted on his huge black destrier, la knight towered above Will y Gared on their smaller garrons. él wore black leather boots, black woolen pants, black moleskin gloves, y un fine supple coat de gleaming black ringmail over layers de black wool y boiled leather. Ser Waymar had been una Sworn Brother del Night’s Watch for less than half una year, but no one could say él had not prepared for his vocation. At least insofar as his wardrobe fue concerned.

His cloak fue his crowning glory; sable, thick y black y soft as sin. “Bet él killed them all himself, él did,” Gared told la barracks over wine, “twisted their little heads off, our mighty warrior.” They had all shared la laugh.

It is hard a take orders from una man tú laughed at in your cups, Will reflected as él sat shivering atop his garron. Gared must have felt la same.

“Mormont said as we should track them, y we did,” Gared said. “They’re dead. They shan’t trouble us no more. There’s hard riding before us. I don’t like this weather. If it snows, we could be una fortnight getting back, y snow’s la best we can hope for. Ever seen an ice storm, my lord?”

The lordling seemed not a hear him. él studied la deepening twilight in that half-bored, half-distracted way él had. Will had ridden with la knight long enough a understand that era best not a interrupt him when él looked like that. “Tell me again what tú saw, Will. All la details. Leave nothing out.”

Will had been una hunter before él joined la Night’s Watch. Well, una poacher in truth. Mallister freeriders had caught him red-handed in la Mallisters’ own woods, skinning one del Mallisters’ own bucks, y eso had been una choice de putting on la black or losing una hand. No one could move through la woods as silent as Will, y eso had not taken la black brothers long a discover his talent.

“The camp is two miles farther on, over that ridge, hard beside una stream,” Will said. “I got close as I dared. There’s eight de them, men y women both. No children I could see. They put up una lean-to against la rock. la snow’s pretty well covered eso now, but I could still make eso out. No fire burning, but la firepit fue still plain as day. No one moving. I watched una long time. No living man ever lay so still.”

“Did tú see any blood?”

“Well, no,” Will admitted.

“Did tú see any weapons?”

“Some swords, una few bows. One man had an axe. Heavy-looking, double-bladed, una cruel piece de iron. Era on la ground beside him, right by his hand.”

“Did tú make note del position del bodies?”

Will shrugged. “una couple are sitting up against la rock. Most de them on la ground. Fallen, like.”

“Or sleeping,” Royce suggested.

“Fallen,” Will insisted. “There’s one woman up an ironwood, half-hid en el branches. una far-eyes.” él smiled thinly. “I took care ella never saw me. When I got closer, I saw that ella wasn’t moving neither.” Despite himself, él shivered.

“You have una chill?” Royce asked.

“Some,” Will muttered. “la wind, m’lord.”

The young knight turned back a his grizzled man-at-arms. Frostfallen leaves whispered past them, y Royce’s destrier moved restlessly. “What do tú think might have killed these men, Gared?” Ser Waymar asked casually. él adjusted la drape de his long sable cloak.

“It fue el cold,” Gared said with iron certainty. “I saw men freeze last winter, y el one before, when I fue half una boy. Everyone talks about snows forty foot deep, y how la ice wind comes howling out del north, but la real enemy is la cold. eso steals up on tú quieter than Will, y at first tú shiver y your teeth chatter y tu stamp your feet y dream de mulled wine y nice hot fires. eso burns, eso does. Nothing burns like la cold. But only for una while. Then eso gets inside usted y starts a fill tú up, y after una while tú don’t have la strength a fight eso. It’s easier just a sit down or go a sleep. They say tú don’t feel any pain toward la end. First tú go weak y drowsy, y everything starts a fade, y then it’s like sinking into una sea de warm milk. Peaceful, like.”

“Such eloquence, Gared,” Ser Waymar observed. “I never suspected tú had en you.”

“I’ve had la cold en me too, lordling.” Gared pulled back his hood, giving Ser Waymar una good long look at la stumps where his ears had been. “Two ears, three toes, y el little finger off mi left hand. I got off light. We found mi brother frozen at su watch, with una smile on su face.”

Ser Waymar shrugged. “tú ought dress more warmly, Gared.”

Gared glared at la lordling, la scars around su ear holes flushed red with anger where Maester Aemon had cut la ears away. “We’ll see how warm tú can dress when la winter comes.” él pulled up su hood y hunched over su garron, silent y sullen.

“If Gared said era el cold…” Will began.

“Have tú drawn any watches this past week, Will?”

“Yes, m’lord.” There never era un week when él did not draw una dozen bloody watches. What fue el man driving at?

“And how did tú find la Wall?”

“Weeping,” Will said, frowning. él saw eso clear enough, now que el lordling had pointed eso out. “They couldn’t have froze. Not if la Wall fue weeping. eso wasn’t cold enough.”

Royce nodded. “Bright lad. We’ve had una few light frosts this past week, y un quick flurry de snow now y then, but surely no cold fierce enough a kill eight grown men. Men clad en fur y leather, let yo remind tú, with shelter near at hand, y el means de making fire.” la knight’s smile fue cocksure. “Will, lead us there. I would see these dead men for myself.”

And then there fue nothing a be done for eso. la order had been given, y honor bound them a obey.

Will went en front, su shaggy little garron picking la way carefully through la undergrowth. una light snow had fallen la night before, y there were stones y roots y hidden sinks lying just under its crust, waiting for la careless y el unwary. Ser Waymar Royce came next, su great black destrier snorting impatiently. la warhorse fue el wrong mount for ranging, but try y tell que a la lordling. Gared brought up la rear. la old man-at-arms muttered a himself as él rode.

Twilight deepened. la cloudless sky turned una deep purple, la color de an old bruise, then faded a black. la stars began a come out. una half-moon rose. Will fue grateful for la light.

“We can make una better pace than this, surely,” Royce said when la moon fue full risen.

“Not con this horse,” Will said. Fear had made him insolent. “Perhaps mi lord would care a take la lead?”

Ser Waymar Royce did not deign a reply.

Somewhere off en el wood una wolf howled.

Will pulled su garron over beneath an ancient gnarled ironwood y dismounted.

“Why are tú stopping?” Ser Waymar asked.

“Best go la rest del way en foot, m’lord. It’s just over ese ridge.”

Royce paused una moment, staring off into la distance, su face reflective. una cold wind whispered through la trees. su great sable cloak stirred behind like something half-alive.

“There’s something wrong here,” Gared muttered.

The young knight gave him una disdainful smile. “Is there?”

“Can’t tú feel eso?” Gared asked. “Listen al darkness.”

Will could feel eso. Four years en el Night’s Watch, y el had never been so afraid. What fue it?

“Wind. Trees rustling. una wolf. Which sound is de esa unmans tú so, Gared?” When Gared did not answer, Royce slid gracefully from su saddle. él tied la destrier securely a un low-hanging limb, well away from la other horses, y drew su longsword from its sheath. Jewels glittered en its hilt, y el moonlight ran down la shining steel. Era un splendid weapon, castle-forged, y new-made from la look de eso. Will doubted eso had ever been swung en anger.

“The trees press close here,” Will warned. “ese sword will tangle tú up, m’lord. Better una knife.”

“If I need instruction, I will ask for " young lord said. “Gared, stay here. Guard la horses.”

Gared dismounted. “We need una fire. I’ll see a it.”

“How big una fool are tú, old man? If there are enemies en this wood, una fire is la last thing we want.”

“There’s some enemies una fire will keep away,” Gared said. “Bears y direwolves y y other things…”

Ser Waymar’s mouth became una hard line. “No fire.”

Gared’s hood shadowed su face, but Will could see la hard glitter en su eyes como el stared en el knight. For una moment él era afraid la older man would go para su sword. Era un short, ugly thing, its grip discolored by sweat, its edge nicked from hard use, but Will would not have given an iron bob Para el lordling’s life if Gared pulled eso from its scabbard.

Finally Gared looked down. “No fire,” él muttered, low under su breath.

Royce took esto para acquiescence y turned away. “Lead sobre él said a Will.

Will threaded their way through una thicket, then started up la slope al low ridge where él tuvo found su vantage point under una sentinel tree. Under la thin crust de snow, la ground fue damp y muddy, slick footing, con rocks y hidden roots a trip tú up. Will made no sound como el climbed. Behind him, él heard la soft metallic slither del lordling’s ringmail, la rustle de leaves, y muttered curses como reaching branches grabbed en su longsword y tugged sobre su splendid sable cloak.

The great sentinel fue right there en el top del ridge, where Will tenía known eso would be, its lowest branches una bare foot off la ground. Will slid en underneath, flat sobre su belly en el snow y el mud, y looked down sobre el empty clearing below.

His heart stopped en su chest. Para moment él dared not breathe. Moonlight shone down sobre el clearing, la ashes del firepit, la snow-covered lean-to, la great rock, la little half-frozen stream. Everything fue just como lo había hecho been una few hours ago.

They were gone. All la bodies were gone.

“Gods!” él heard behind él. una sword slashed en un branch como Ser Waymar Royce gained la ridge. él stood there beside la sentinel, longsword en hand, su cloak billowing behind él como el wind came up, outlined nobly against la stars para all a see.

“Get down!” Will whispered urgently. “Something’s wrong.”

Royce did not move. él looked down en el empty clearing y laughed. “Your dead men seem a have moved camp, Will.”

Will’s voice abandoned él. él groped para words ese did not come. Era not possible. su eyes swept back y forth over la abandoned campsite, stopped sobre el axe. una huge double-bladed battle-axe, still lying where él tuvo seen eso last, untouched. una valuable weapon…

“On your feet, Will,” Ser Waymar commanded. “There’s no one here. I won’t have tú hiding under una bush.”

Reluctantly, Will obeyed.

Ser Waymar looked él over con open disapproval. “I am not going back a Castle Black una failure en mi first ranging. We will find these men.” él glanced around. “Up la tree. ser quick about eso. Look para fire.”

Will turned away, wordless. There fue no use a argue. la wind fue moving. eso cut right through él. él went al tree, una vaulting grey-green sentinel, y began a climb. Soon su hands were sticky con sap, y él fue lost among la needles. Fear filled su gut like una meal él could not digest. él whispered una prayer al nameless gods del wood, y slipped su dirk free de its sheath. él put eso between su teeth a keep both hands free para climbing. la taste de cold iron en su mouth gave él comfort.

Down below, la lordling called out suddenly, “Who goes there?” Will heard uncertainty en el challenge. él stopped climbing; él listened; él watched.

The woods gave answer: la rustle de leaves, la icy rush del stream, una distant hoot de un snow owl.
