“We should start back,” Gared urged as la woods began a grow dark around them. “los wildlings are dead.”

“Do la dead frighten you?” Ser Waymar Royce asked with just la hint de un smile.

Gared did not rise al bait. He was an old man, past fifty, y he had seen la lordlings come y go. “Dead is dead,” he said. “We have no business with la dead.”

“Are they dead?” Royce asked softly. “What proof have we?”

“Will saw them,” Gared said. “If he says they are dead, that’s proof enough for me.”

Will had known they would drag him into la quarrel sooner or later. Él wished it had been later rather than sooner. “My mother told me that dead men sing no songs,” él put in.

“My wet nurse said la same thing, Will,” Royce replied. “Never believe anything you hear at una woman’s tit. There are things a be learned even from la dead.” His voice echoed, too loud in la twilit forest.

“We have una long ride before us,” Gared pointed out. “Eight days, maybe nine. Y night is falling.”

Ser Waymar Royce glanced at la sky with disinterest. “It does that every day about this time. Are tú unmanned by la dark, Gared?”

Will could see la tightness around Gared’s mouth, la barely suppressed anger in his eyes under la thick black hood de his cloak. Gared had spent forty years in la Night’s Watch, man y boy, y él fue not accustomed a being made light de. Yet era more than that. Under la wounded pride, Will could sense something else en el older man. usted could taste eso; una nervous tension that came perilous close a fear.

Will shared his unease. Él had been four years on la Wall. los first time él had been sent beyond, all la old stories had come rushing back, y his bowels had turned a water. Él had laughed about eso afterward. El era un veteran de un hundred rangings by now, y el endless dark wilderness that la southron called la haunted forest had no more terrors for him.

Until tonight. Something fue different tonight. There fue an edge a this darkness that made his hackles rise. Nine days they had been riding, north y northwest y then north again, farther y farther from la Wall, hard on la track de un band de wildling raiders. Each day had been worse than la day ese had come before eso. Today fue el worst de all. UNA cold wind fue blowing out del north, y eso made la trees rustle like living things. All day, Will had felt as though something were watching him, something cold y implacable ese loved him not. Gared had felt eso too. Will wanted nothing so much as a ride hellbent for la safety del Wall, but eso fue not una feeling a share with your commander.

Especially not una commander like this one.

Ser Waymar Royce fue el youngest son de an ancient house with too many heirs. El era un handsome youth de eighteen, grey-eyed y graceful y slender as una knife. Mounted on su huge black destrier, la knight towered above Will y Gared on their smaller garrons. Él wore black leather boots, black woolen pants, black moleskin gloves, y un fine supple coat de gleaming black ringmail over layers de black wool y boiled leather. Ser Waymar had been una Sworn Brother del Night’s Watch for less than half una year, but no one could say él had not prepared for su vocation. At least insofar as su wardrobe fue concerned.

His cloak era su crowning glory; sable, thick y black y soft as sin. “Bet él killed them all himself, él did,” Gared told la barracks over wine, “twisted their little heads off, our mighty warrior.” They had all shared la laugh.

It is hard a take orders from una man tú laughed at en your cups, Will reflected as él sat shivering atop su garron. Gared must have felt la same.

“Mormont said as we should track them, y we did,” Gared said. “They’re dead. They shan’t trouble us no more. There’s hard riding before us. I don’t like this weather. If eso snows, we could be una fortnight getting back, y snow’s la best we can hope for. Ever seen an ice storm, mi lord?”

The lordling seemed not a hear him. Él studied la deepening twilight en eso half-bored, half-distracted way él had. Will had ridden con el knight long enough a understand que era best not a interrupt him when él looked like ese. “Tell yo again what tú saw, Will. All la details. Leave nothing out.”

Will had been una hunter before él joined la Night’s Watch. Well, una poacher en truth. Mallister freeriders had caught him red-handed en el Mallisters’ own woods, skinning one del Mallisters’ own bucks, y tenia been una choice de putting sobre el black or losing una hand. No one could move through la woods como silent como Will, y tenia not taken la black brothers long a discover su talent.

“The camp is two miles farther en, over ese ridge, hard beside una stream,” Will said. “I got close como I dared. There’s eight de them, men y women both. No children I could see. They put up una lean-to against la rock. los snow’s pretty well covered eso now, but I could still make eso out. No fire burning, pero el firepit fue still plain como day. No one moving. I watched una long time. No living man ever lay so still.”
